 * My name is Tom Pearson I make maps and graphics currently at th FT.
 * SO! Data Driven Documents - D3
 * made by Mike Bostock currently of the New York Times as part of his Phd studies http://vis.stanford.edu/files/2011-D3-InfoVis.pdf
 * I'm goign to go give a ten minute overview of the features and suggest some ways to get into the D3 mindset and make the most of this truely excellent toolkit.

SO!
 * At its root it's a way to bind data to elements in your web page and their properties
 * by elements I mean text, list items, divs, table cells but most commonly SVG

But importantly What isn't D3
 * Not a quick way to make a bar chart
 * The traditional approach to charting is to provide a bunch of presets and then allow customisation
 * D3 provides lower level primitives allowing for more power and flexibility at the cost of a steeper learning curve getting your head around these primitives a key part of making the most of D3 
 * think broadly of what constitutes data and creatively about how you can show it.
 
D3 can seem like a steep lerning curve but you don't have to learn it all at once
 * It's nice and modular so it lends itself to learning in steps ( for the download weight concious theres a tool for quickly making custom builds of just the bits you need https://github.com/mbostock/smash/wiki )
 * The key to D3 is joining arrays of data to selections of page elements -when you change the data those changes can be mapped to the page elements adjusting their position, size, colour or any otehr property you can think of this is where the learnign curve is though and I can do the topic of data joins justice in the time I have SO: https://d233eq3e3p3cv0.cloudfront.net/max/700/0*XAKK48y6DWpLhbDO.jpeg

So here are some other useful bits
 * Data loading, convenient methods for getting CSVs(or TSVs) and json and XML if you have to
 * Data transfomation. Hint: spend time getting your data into a shape that works nicely with D3, certain parts eg. layouts are easier to work with if your data matches the way D3 expects. 
 * Arrays! Nest, Max, min, mean, median, quantiles and more espescially useful is extent which retruns a the maximum and minimum values of an array
 * Scales! Objects that convert values from the data to screen coordinates (or colours, or angles or...)
 * Coordinates and Geography! Methods for reading, projecting and drawing geographical shapes, geoJSON - Jason Davies
 * Guides! Axes, graticules etc.

Finally
  A great way to learn is by looking at small self contained examples. Luckily there's a lot of them about
