Points
Me
 - I've been making visual explanations/ infographics etc for nearly a decade. Right now I do this for the Financial Time (hence the pink... very frustrating choosing colours that work on that background)
 - I've been doing this mainly using the - data visualisation library - D3 for the last 18 monts or so (though I dabbled before)
  Examples: Lists of things I've read, Supermarket loyalty cards, Chess openings, Economic data (maps), Time
 - I love D3 (I admit slightly to the 'everything looks like a nail when you have a hammer' problem. but it's a really cool hammer!)

 Myths about D3 
 - it's hard
 	- Yes, theres a lot of it but you don't need to understand everything at once to get value from it.
 	- one bit at a time, I'll show you a couple of small gems in there that you'll find uses for all the time.
 - it's for making charts
 	- you can make charts with it but its more general than that.
 	- The typical approach of most data viz packages is to provide a selection of chart types, let you choose one and then fiddle with the fonts and colours, that's fine but if you want to go a bit further - say colour the bars of a bar chart by a separate variable, well you're out of luck. D3 provides smaller more flexible and crucially more reusable components, this can be a bit of a culture shock so I'll show you a way to think systematically about visualisations in D3

 We can do it!

 - The way I think about D3 projects
 	- Data (data includes) > Page elements (page elements include)
 	- Data > Transfomrations > Scales > Page elements

 - Specifics
	- Data Loading
		- csv
	- Array manipulations
	- Data binding
		- 
	- Scales
		- think of an example
		100 meters final times 2012 [9.63, 9.75, 9.79, 9.80, 9.88, 9.94, 9.98, 11.99]
	- Page elements

 - Final advice
 	- use the examples (there's LOADs of them)
 	- but you can't beat the experience of making something from scratch
 	- work on small things, add them together to make bigger things
 	- a little planning goes a long way
	 	- think broadly about what constitutes data
	 	- sketch what you want to achieve on a piece of paper first, which attributes of an element map to which property of the data
	 	- spend a bit of time getting your data into a sensible form before joining it to page elements
